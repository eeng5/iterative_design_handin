                    <br>
                    <p><u>Introduction</u>
                        <br>Kuleana is a startup that specializes in plant based raw tuna. There are several companies that make vegetable based meat substitutes, such as Beyond Meat, but currently, there is yet to be an established seafood equivalent. Kuleana hopes to capitalize on this by creating 100 percent plant based, sushi-grade raw tuna so that consumers can enjoy fish without the environmental and ethical consequences.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u>Project Context</u>
                        <br>The goal of this project was to design an interface for an emerging startup. Our group chose to design a website for Kuleana with the purpose of informing consumers about the product and company while providing an easy way to purchase the tuna. Because we focused our design on being intuitive and simple, new and returning customers will be impacted by having a faster experience purchasing the tuna. After many iterations of sketches and wireframes, the project culminated in completing a final hifi mockup of what a website made for Kuleana might look like. We then conducted user testing of this final prototype using the remote user testing service <a class="blue-text" href="https://www.usertesting.com/" target="_blank">UserTesting.com</a>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u>Sketching</u>
                        <br>We made four different possible designs for our startup’s app. Please note the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each group member drew 4 separate sketches. The sketches represented different pages that might exist on a website for Kuleana. In total, we had 8 different pages that we attempted to represent.</li>
                            <li>From our 16 sketches, we narrowed down the number of total screens that we were considering for our website from 8 to 4, based on which screens we thought were most important to achieving our goal of informing the user about the product and providing a way to purchase the product. For example, a page devoted to purchasing the product was prioritized over a “meet the team” page.</li>
                            <li>We also prioritized creative ideas and pages that would allow for a greater variety of layouts, while still keeping fundamental consistency throughout the website.</li>
                            <li>We chose to use the navbar from sketch 1 as the main design for the navbar due to its simplicity and symmetry.</li>
                            <li>We decided on a color scheme that included a lot of green to reinforce the company’s values of sustainability and environmental friendliness. We also decided on a circular or rounded edges design to provide cohesion to the website.</li>
                        </ul></p>

                    <p><u>Interactive High Fidelity Mockup</u>
                        <br>We used Figma to create a hi-fi prototype - an enhanced version of our final wireframe - populated with realistic content. This involved making several design choices:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Hierarchy: </b>We chose fonts and font sizes based on their function on the site. For example, we had one main title font and font size. Smaller titles followed a consistent styling and size as well, and we also had a consistent paragraph font size.</li>
                            <li><b>Interaction: </b>We decided to focus on making interaction straight-forward and easy to use. For example, we provided explicit instructions on hovering on our Mission page to eliminate any possible confusion. Furthermore, clickable elements would be enlarged and have a green border upon hover to make it clear that they can be clicked.</li>
                            <li><b>Navigation: </b>Our navbar contained the main sections of the site, which were accessible from every page. Certain pages also featured buttons that would navigate to different parts of the site such as the checkout button on the shop page.</li>
                        </ul></p>

                        <br>For the mockup crit we had 1 minute to briefly introduce out startup and prototype. Our peers then interacted with our prototype for 2 minutes. We received feedback from both our peers and a guest industry critic. The following table lists the feedback we received and the changes we made in response.</p>

                              <td>We replaced the purchase button with a download button, which we believe would be more helpful and intuitive for users since we also added a Shop page to the nav bar.</td>

                    <p>Having test participants try out an interface is an important part of testing and a valuable source of feedback. We conducted our own usability test through a remote user testing service (<a class="blue-text" href="https://www.usertesting.com/" target="_blank">UserTesting.com</a>), using our interactive hi-fi prototype. We selected one task (which consisted of several sub-tasks) that we wanted users to complete on our interactive prototype.

                    <p><u>Analysis of Results</u>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first task evaluated the website’s clarity in describing Kuleana’s purpose.
                                <ul class="inner_list">
                                    <li class="arrow">Though this task was intended to be given after users explored the website, users were able to gather enough information about Kuleana and the product from the Home page.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>The second task evaluated the users’ understanding of Kuleana’s values and whether knowing more about the company helped improve their opinion about Kuleana.
                                <ul class="inner_list">
                                    <li class="arrow">All users were able to clearly relay what Kuleana’s mission and product are.</li>
                                    <li class="arrow">User 1 and 2 wished they knew what the tuna is made from. For example, User 1 noted that knowing what proteins were used in making the fish would help drive her to make a purchase.</li>
                                    <li class="arrow">In contrast, User 3 said that the company mission, recipes, and community images made his mouth water and made him eager to purchase our product.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>The third and fourth subtasks tested whether users were able to effectively navigate the website and accomplish the given tasks. 
                                <ul class="inner_list">
                                    <li class="arrow">All users accomplished the two tasks in one to two minutes per task and noted that everything was very straightforward.</li>
                                    <li class="arrow">Users noted that downloading a recipe would be effective in helping drive purchases because the described meals are much more appealing than just the tuna.</li>
                                    <li class="arrow">Shopping was very intuitive and every user understood exactly what to do. User 3 even explained how the edit button would take him back to the previous page and then allow him to select a different order before he clicked it.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Overall, users were able to quickly and easily navigate through the website to accomplish the primary task in approximately seven minutes.</li>
                        </ul></p>

                    <p><u>Errors and User Suggestions</u>
                        <br>Overall, the responses and results were in line with our expectations, however, we noticed a few pain points.
                        <ul>
                            <li>At times, users struggled with the nav bar because Figma’s overlay would occasionally cover it.</li>
                            <li>Two users failed to realize that the Mission page held more information at the bottom of the page in one of the bubbles. User 1 also failed to realize that the page was scrollable.</li>
                            <li>User 1 never clicked on the clickable post on the Community page.</li>
                            <li>To improve the design, all users suggested making pages more animated and interesting.</li>
                            <li>User 3 suggested including a title for the product on the Shop page for scalability if we expand our product line.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <i>Despite these, all users noted that the website had a very clean aesthetic and was intuitive and easy-to-use.</i></p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u>Adjustments</u>
                        <br>When designing the prototype, we deliberated over balancing functionality with eye-catching aesthetics. Though certain pages can be enhanced with more animations, our tests revealed that the prototype’s consistent structure and effects contributed to an intuitive user experience. Therefore, we would look to add more descriptions and images to make our website more appealing and informative but be cautious of adding too many effects. We appreciated User 3's comment about adding a title for our product and would add that as well.</p>
